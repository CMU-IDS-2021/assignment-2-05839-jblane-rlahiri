ABSTRACT: COVID-19 has become large part of our every day lives. People walk around in public areas covered in masks trying to maintain a six feet distance away from each other. School attendance is limited in many areas of the country, and some people have not seen grandparents in many months. This past February (2021), the number of U.S. deaths related to COVID-19 exceeded half a million people. There is no wonder that citizens worry about whether or not they or people in their community may contract the virus. With the increasing death toll, though, how worried are people about becoming sick or spreading the sickness to others? Are they worried enough to quarantine themselves, only leaving the home for essential items? The purpose of this visualization is to take a look at the emotional state of counties within Pennsylvania and compare the information to whether or not this affects overall tendencies to conduct non-essential activities such as going to bars and restaurants.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to determine if people's concern are about whether or not they or members of their community become ill from COVID-19 affect their tendencies to conduct non-essential activities such as going to bars and restaurants. The focus is on Pennsylvania, the home of Carnegie Mellon University where this visualization is developed, and covers a two-month period (Nov-Dec 2020). This is an interesting period because it encompasses Thanksgiving and the winter holidays - events known to increase social gatherings between people. Users should be able to take a look at different counties, select the metrics that they want to observe, and easily make a comparison between the overall emotional state and the level of non-essential activities.


## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices? state data - less , dates - less 
Challenges: large amount of data too many data sets
Data: how to organize the data? csv? pull? 

## Development

Once assigned the project, Janice (J) and Riddhiman (R) met at least twice a week to discuss the planning process and goals, reevaluate the direction of the project, and discuss any challenges or recommendations. In the first meeting, we focused on making a plan to meet certain milestones by the assignment due date and assigning responsibilities. J was responsibility for visualizing the emotional states, and R was responsibility for the map and the non-essential activities. Both contributed on ideas to help improve each other's area of focus as well as the overall scheme of the project. Because of the constraints of other classes, R conducted most of his programming during the earlier parts of the planning period, and J conducted the bulk of her programming during the later part. We still met before completing the assignment to agree on the design and make any last minute changes. Since Altair and Streamlit are new to both of us, it probably took about 20 hours each of programming time. Additionally, we conducted 5 one-hour long planning meetings and corresponded through email. The most
